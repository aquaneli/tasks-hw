England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.[6] It is located on the island of Great Britain, 
of which it covers approximately 62%, and over 100 smaller adjacent islands. It has land borders with Scotland 
to the north and Wales to the west, and is otherwise surrounded by the North Sea to the east, the English Channel 
to the south, the Celtic Sea to the south-west, and the Irish Sea to the west. Continental Europe lies to the south-east, 
and Ireland to the west. At the 2021 census, the population was 56,490,048.[1] London is both the largest city and the capital.
The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic. It takes its name 
from the Angles, a Germanic tribe who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in 
the 10th century and has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the Age of Discovery, which 
began during the 15th century.[7] The Kingdom of England, which included Wales after 1535, ceased to be a separate sovereign 
state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union brought into effect a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland that created the Kingdom of Great Britain.[8]
England is the origin of the English language, the English legal system (which served as the basis for the common 
law systems of many other countries), association football, and the Anglican branch of Christianity; its parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations.[9] The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.[10] England is home to the two oldest universities in the English-speaking world: the University of Oxford, founded in 1096, and the University of Cambridge, founded in 1209. Both universities are ranked among the most prestigious in the world.[11][12]
